# SongQuiz

## "Guess the song/artist" type of game

Front-end repo, Built with Svelte + SMUI + Vite + Socket.IO
Back-end (Node.JS) repo: [Levyks/songquiz-backend](https://github.com/Levyks/songquiz-backend)

Work In Progress, I'll be remaking the game in this repo, with a better UI (using Material UI, with dark mode support), more features, TypeScript, Vite, and generally cleaner code, I also hope to improve the way the client/server communication is done.

TODOs in [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MrgPAn1e/songquiz)
